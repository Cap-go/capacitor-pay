# Apple Pay Setup Guide

This document walks through the steps required to enable Apple Pay in a project that uses `@capgo/capacitor-pay`. Complete every step before calling the plugin at runtime.

## 1. Accounts and prerequisites

- Enroll in the Apple Developer Program using the same Apple ID that signs your iOS builds.
- Ensure your app bundle identifier is reserved in App Store Connect.
- Use Xcode 14 or newer, and install the latest iOS SDK.

## 2. Create a Merchant ID

1. Open [Apple Developer > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).
2. In **Identifiers**, click the plus button and choose **Merchant IDs**.
3. Enter a description and a unique identifier following the pattern `merchant.com.yourcompany.app`.
4. Save the identifier. This Merchant ID will later be referenced in code as `merchantIdentifier`.

## 3. Add the Apple Pay capability

1. Open the iOS workspace or the Capacitor iOS project in Xcode.
2. Select the app target, open the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, and click **+ Capability**.
3. Choose **Apple Pay**, then select the merchant ID you created earlier.
4. Xcode generates an `App.entitlements` file with the `com.apple.developer.in-app-payments` entry. Confirm that the Merchant ID is listed.

## 4. Generate the payment processing certificate

1. In the developer portal, open the Merchant ID details.
2. Under **Payment Processing Certificate**, click **Create Certificate**.
3. Download the certificate signing request (`.certSigningRequest`) generated by Xcode (`Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority`).
4. Upload the CSR, download the resulting certificate, and double-click it to add it to your keychain.
5. Export the certificate as a `.cer` file and keep it for your payment service provider if required.

## 5. Configure the payment processor or gateway

Most processors request the Merchant ID and the payment processing certificate. Provide:

- Merchant identifier (e.g., `merchant.com.yourcompany.app`)
- Business legal name and contact information
- The `.cer` file generated in the previous step

Follow your processor’s onboarding steps to complete tokenization.

## 6. Verify domain association (if applicable)

If your payment processor requires Apple Pay on the web, add your site domain in the developer portal and upload the `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` file to `https://<domain>/.well-known/`.

## 7. Update the Capacitor project

- In `Pay.requestPayment`, set `merchantIdentifier` to the Merchant ID created earlier.
- Provide a list of networks (`supportedNetworks`) that matches the networks approved by your processor.
- Include realistic summary items and ensure the total is a final amount.

## 8. Build and test on device

- Apple Pay is unavailable on the iOS simulator. Use a real device signed into an Apple ID with a supported card in Wallet.
- Install the build via Xcode or TestFlight.
- Trigger `Pay.isPayAvailable()` to ensure the device reports `available: true`.
- Call `Pay.requestPayment` and verify that the Apple Pay sheet loads and returns a payment token.

## 9. Move to production

- Disable the sandbox merchant environment in your processor dashboard once you’re ready for production.
- Rebuild the app using distribution certificates and submit the build for App Review.
- Provide Apple with sample test accounts or screenshots showing the Apple Pay flow, if requested.

After these steps the Capacitor plugin can successfully authorize payments using Apple Pay.
